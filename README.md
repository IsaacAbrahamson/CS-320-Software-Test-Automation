## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by developing using good programing practices as well as thoroughly testing based on requirements. In this project, I achieved full test coverage for all classes.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpreting user needs is one of the most important parts of software development. This is usually something that comes with experience with the project, because once you understand more about how the software works and its purpose you can understand the needs of users better. Often incoporate the needs can go beyond just what users specifically say because you understand the real needs and are able to provide better value.

## How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by understanding the needs of the stakeholders. This includes the company and software itself as well as the needs of the users. Once both of these things are understood, software can be made that meets the needs of the users quickly while still being maintainable and capable long-term.
